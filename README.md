This project is a supervised text classification task for articles. I am using the python library, Ktrain, to train a deep learning binary classification model. The notebook contains the EDA, data processing, model training and evaluation process. The link to the Google Colab version of the notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bExe6Dki-FHBqc8BEMvnn0w3rukXkP0Z?usp=sharing).
